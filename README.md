# Berlin-Airbnb-data

The following is the description of the project that I did as a part of the Udacity's Data Scientist nanodegree. 

## Libraries used 

The python's numpy, pandas and scikit-learn libraries were used in this project

## Structure of the project 

The project, follows or at least attempts to follow the CRISP-DM process. The 5 main steps are described below: 

### Introduction 

In introduction you will find the outline of the project and the questions which I attempt to find answers to. Which are: 
#### 1. What are the factors that influence the price of the apartments ? 


#### 2. What are the neighbourhoods with the highest priced appartments ? 


#### 3. What are the neighbourhoods with the lowest priced appartments ? 


### Business Understanding

A relative short section given that the business model of Aribnb is widely known 

### Data Understanding 

Airbnb provides the data and the data dictionary. Both sources of the data are linked in the project

### Modell 

In the modell part I attempt to use machine learning to create a model that determines the price. 
Unfortunately, given to many features, and to few observations do not allow us to create a meaningful model. 
A simpler corelation is attempted and the data is manipulated in a way to give insights related to the remaining questions




### Evaluation 

The conclusions of the project
